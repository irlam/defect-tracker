Permission breakdown by role:

Admin: All permissions
Manager: Most permissions except system management
Contractor: Basic defect management and updates
Viewer: Read-only access
Client: Basic viewing and commenting capabilities

-- Example: Assign a user to the manager role (replace USER_ID with actual user id)
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id, created_by)
VALUES (
    USER_ID, 
    (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'manager'),
    'irlam'
);




This is the initial setup. Would you like me to continue with:

Next, we can create:

The defect creation form with floor plan pin placement
Project management pages
User management system
Detailed defect view page
Email notification system
The frontend JavaScript for handling floor plan interactions
The floor plan viewer component
The defect pin placement functionality
The admin interface for managing floor plans
Add a change history tracking system?
Add a view to show recent updates?
Add an audit log for changes?

==example prompt code for changing the navbar to pages==
add the navbar to contractors.php,i will share the code, then post back the full contractors.php with the navbar included, including any required css to keep the formating, share the full code in 2 parts




Defect creation system with floor plan integration
Email notification system
API endpoints for mobile integration
Report generation system
Please let me know which part you'd like me to focus on next, and I'll provide the detailed code and explanation for that component.

The system will be built using:

PHP 7.4+ for backend
MySQL 5.7+ for database
Bootstrap 5 for frontend
jQuery for AJAX operations
PHPMailer for email notifications
REST API for mobile app integration
Each component will be modular and well-documented for easy maintenance and future expansion. Would you like me to proceed with any specific component?
